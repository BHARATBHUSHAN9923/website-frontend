Though Ubisoft has dug up some of its stealth-action roots to make that style more appealing, Valhalla’s focus is on the absolutely massive recreation of Dark Ages England, brought to life with stunning beauty and a level of detail I’ve rarely seen. It’s been an impressive showcase for the Xbox Series X (and presumably the PlayStation 5, but Ubisoft only gave us access to the Xbox version ahead of launch), playing in 4K and a near-constant 60 frames per second. You have to put up with some new progression system ideas that don’t quite deliver, and an abundance of bugs, but there’s a staggering number of things to do, explore, and discover in and around Valhalla’s more atmospheric storytelling.\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla’s story follows Eivor, a male or female Norse Viking who grows up with a chip on their shoulder and vengeance in their heart after some particularly dastardly events in the opening cinematic. From those starting moments, the table is set and soon you and your brother Sigurd are off on a grand adventure to England, a land ripe with wealth and glory, and already well-integrated with Danes and Norse from years of Viking invasion and conquest. That sets the stage for your arrival in England as you settle the land and forge alliances to protect and expand your fledgling homestead against the chaos and political dust storm of warring factions across England’s four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria, and Wessex.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time Assassin’s Creed tried letting us choose to play as a male or female protagonist the results were hit or miss, especially on the male side. Here, however, the performances of both the male and female versions of Eivor are admirable, though some accents drift a bit. (At one point I could’ve sworn female Eivor made a stop in Boston from the way she crushed the word “harbor,” but quickly enough it was back to Norse normal.) These brief moments are absolutely the exception to the otherwise steady and earnest delivery throughout, which is also true of most of the main characters. Outside the main cast, though some random NPCs can be a little… much. But special mention goes out to Sigurd, who channels fiery intensity and flirts with crazy in his performances, and that performance is accentuated by fascinating facial expressions that often lean uncomfortably close to the latter.\n\nThe siblings' quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect.\nEven so, the siblings’ quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect. There are moments throughout where the griefstriken, bittersweet, and just plain bitter resolutions reminded me of The Witcher 3’s Bloody Baron delivery. This is a dirty, dingy world where life is cheap and nearly everyone is scratching and clawing to gain power – or to keep it – regardless of who gets burned along the way.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne particular instance found me helping the leader of a nearby shire – regions within the four kingdoms (no hobbits) – who had discovered a traitor in her inner circle and charged me with rooting them out because she loved each one of them as family and couldn’t trust herself to see past their lies. The resulting few hours of investigation brought me to the end of the road, and I made the best decision based on the available information I had. To be honest, I’m not sure I was right; I still don’t know. If the person I accused was guilty, Valhalla never gave me more clarity, and the uncertainty seems very intentional. My judgment was accepted and the consequences were swiftly doled out, and that was that. I’ve found myself thinking about that decision ever since. But that’s the business of eighth-century England, I suppose.\nA World Separated by an Ocean\nValhalla’s vast interpretation of The Dark Ages of Britain is massive, and when coupled with a significant portion of Norway, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla presents a staggeringly large playground through which you ply your trade. And no matter where you are, it’s absolutely stunning.\nBeyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s England is in turmoil. It’s home to clashes between Danes, Norse, Saxons, Britons, Picts, and more, all of whom have stuck a claim in one hunk of rock or another and will kill you to defend it – or to take it, depending on which side of the fence you happen to land on. It’s a confusing mess of integration that creates an excellent social and political knot into which to tie this story, compounded by cultural and religious elements that really drive a sense of otherness in the many different regions, even if they’re just down the river.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as all Assassin’s Creed games do, the undercurrent of Assassins versus the Order of the Ancients runs everywhere. It’s well represented in the various factions, and even in the decaying bones of the Roman Empire whose structures and architecture not only litter every region, but serve as excellent places to delve into the necessary long-forgotten tombs, crypts, and subterranean structures the series needs to hide its ancient order secrets. Again, that’s similar to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, but much of the legwork of hunting down The Order is optional outside the main antagonists that inject themselves into your tale and force that storyline.\n\nBeyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin's Creed Valhalla's England is in turmoil.\n\nIn fact, the Assassin’s Brotherhood elements that rope Eivor in start softly, slowly weaving in and out of their story with admirable restraint before the usual Dan-Brown-ification picks up and reveals everything is touched by these organizations in one form or another. But the focus rarely shifts completely from the Eivor’s more-engaging efforts to build a network of alliances throughout England’s four kingdoms and its many, many shires.\n\nOne final note before we move on, without spoiling anything: as a huge fan of mythology, I’m stupidly excited for everyone to see Ubisoft’s interpretation of the Norse pantheon and Asgard. Tackling something so mystical and otherworldly had to be tough, but the end result is a more “realistic” and granular take on it than you’d be used to if your familiarity revolves around the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comic books. That’s not a slight on either, just an acknowledgement that this is a refreshing change of pace, especially considering how insane Norse mythology is when you get into the weeds.\nTo Go A Viking\nMany of Valhalla’s consistent high points come as you live the life of a stereotypical Viking. Aboard your customizable longship, you’ll sail along snaking rivers and lead your clan in raids against the gold-swollen churches and monasteries of England, bloated with supplies and materials needed to build your new settlement that then acts as your homebase and quest hub. The pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray. Even after so many hours, I’ve yet to grow tired of blowing the horn as we approach the shore, and running up the hill as imposing stone steeples adorned in crosses and decoration tower over. It’s a welcome distraction from longer and more involved quest chains, and provides a quick hit of combat serotonin when you just need to bury your axe in something.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray.\n\nLike many wars of that time, eventually you’re going to have to siege a castle or fortress, and that’s where Valhalla really cranks up the medievalness. These mass assaults often serve as the payoffs for longer quest chains, pitting your armies against whatever upstart king, jarl, or noble calls themselves lord of the lands you aim to conquer. These battles are fever-pitched and chaotic, and while they’re often impressive to look at they usually require a small checklist of orderly tasks to complete: ram the gates to smithereens, breach the inner keep, and kill the despot at the center. After a few of these you can start to pick up the patterns, but often they involve scouting defenses and softening up the opposition before going in, so that adds an element of strategy to it even if it eventually boils down to you taking on the big bad guy at the end. Still, breaking through fortifications with siege weaponry and working toward the inner keep is a very cool spectacle and captures the grandeur of all-out warfare that’s befitting a story of conquering kingdoms.\n\nBut when you’re done pillaging on your raid or shoring up an alliance with the new ruler you’ve installed, it’s time to spend those supplies and raw materials. For that we return to the Settlement, a place to invest your resources that serves not only as your quest hub, but as a separate layer of progression with tangible benefits.\n\nAs you begin to build out your settlement you’ll construct vital locations like a merchant to quickly buy and sell goods, a barracks to recruit and hand-pick your raiding party, a stable to buy mounts and upgrade riding abilities, a blacksmith to upgrade weapons and armor, and much, much more. On the surface, these are welcome additions and giving you stake of land to handle your business definitely beats tracking down merchants in the big wide world. It’s a little bastion of productivity that you’ll revisit again and again, and serves as the welcome “come home” location where you’ll plan your campaign across England, and dive into side character backstories and storylines.\n\nI'd love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay.\nAt first, the settlement had me excited, because I love a good management experience – especially when everything offers some kind of reward to further power my character. Eventually, though, as upgrades and management started to slow down and shifted away from unlocking cool new things to getting statistical bonuses, the allure of my settlement began to dwindle and I found myself spending less on my building plans and more time just getting my shopping done before I went out to discover new interesting things. To be fair, there are strong elements at play in your settlement – like the shopkeepers and characters that live and work there which you’ll get to know and potentially care about – but I hope it’s a mechanic that Ubisoft continues to flesh it out in future Assassin’s Creeds entries because I’d love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay to make me want to spend time there for reasons other than a trade and quest depot.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, You Want to Be an Assassin?\nSince Assassin’s Creed Origins, Ubisoft has continued to transplant the series from the stealth-action genre to the more wider appealing open-world action RPG landscape. It’s a change that I’ve personally really enjoyed, since a big, immersive open-world loaded with oddities and things to do punches my ticket. But it’s come with the completely fair criticism that, when you carry the existing brand into new territory, it can alienate existing fans of the series that really miss and expect that subtle, nuanced gameplay of getting in, making the kill, and getting out without being seen.\n\nThe stat-driven RPG nature of this new era of Assassin’s Creed games has made this next to impossible because assassinations are subject to leashed power based on your enemy’s level and your overall effectiveness at dealing backstab-y damage. So unless you’re building into your stealth and assassination styles heavily, and trying to backstab enemies around your same level, odds are that when you stick them with the pointy end they take a ton of damage but don’t actually die, and have to be finished off with a decidedly un-stealthy battle. I can see how that’s frustrating for anybody who misses that kind of gameplay – especially since the series continues to trend toward emphasizing combat.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla, to Ubisoft’s credit, attempts to keep one foot on both sides, and it mostly succeeds thanks to a number of options that allow you to dial in your preferred style of play. The “vanilla” answer to this problem is in the skill tree. So if you play on the default difficulty, and default stealth difficulty (more on that in a minute), you can find ways to get closer to the original Assassin’s Creed style without going into the options menu.\n\nSpecifically, there’s a skill called Advanced Assassination that allows you to overcome enemy level difference and power imbalance as long as you hit the quick-time event prompt. I love this approach, personally, because it puts the onus on you to perform and seal the deal if your timing is right. If it’s wrong, you’re going to pay for it when the big Viking turns on you and the alarm bells sound off. That’s the definition of a high-risk, high-reward playstyle.\n\nIf that’s still not close enough to home, you’re in luck, because there’s an outside gameplay tool in the options menu called Guaranteed Assassination that allows you to assassinate ALL enemies in one shot, regardless of level, every time. However, it does come with the following note: “Please note that when choosing this option, you are not playing the game as it was intended to be experienced.” So, take that as you will (it’ll probably lead to some missions being laughably easy) but know that it’s there.\n\nFinally, if you really want to dial in your assassination experience, you’ve got some control over the difficulty settings to get you there. Just as you turn on Guaranteed Assassinations for that old-school feel, you can independently crank the combat difficulty up as far as you can stand it in order to punish yourself for getting caught. And you can tailor the stealth difficulty as well, which manipulates a number of factors in the stealth system to allow for an easier or harder approach.\n\nSo there you go. If you’ve been on the “It’s not an Assassin’s Creed game anymore” train, Valhalla has a number of stops for you to hop off at should you take a detour through the options menu.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying Things Out\nWhile Valhalla faithfully sticks to the open-world script of Origins and Odyssey, there are some new systems in play, for better and worse. This time around, skill progression and abilities have been decoupled, meaning you no longer gain cool new abilities automatically simply through leveling up. In fact, the entire level system is effectively gone. Though you still earn experience, and it’s still cached at steady intervals to reward you with skill points, you don’t gain levels in the traditional format.\n\nThose skills points you earn are spent on the Skill Tree, which is more of a web, linking various clusters of unlockable upgrades into constellations that you work your way through along the three main regions: combat, stealth, and ranged. On paper it’s a good system, and slightly reminiscent of Skyrim in style, but for me it’s ultimately a step backward, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, while you’ll know which direction to invest in from the start depending on what pillar you want to go toward first, once you’ve unlocked the skill at the center of the cluster you’ve got to decide which direction to move from there. Do you work toward the left, to the right? Normally you’d likely take a look at the skills further down the tree and figure out where you want to end up, but that’s the rub: every neighboring cluster is hidden by fog until you spend the necessary points to unlock the node that connects one cluster to another. What this means is you don’t know what the skill in the next group is going to be until you spend a few points to head that direction. That’s really frustrating early on, when you sink your valuable early points only to reveal a skill you don’t care about.\n\nNumbers aren't fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you're a tornado of sharp edges? That's fun!\n\n“But there’s still value in the smaller nodes between the main skills in each constellation,” you might say, being technically correct. And that’s true. But these nodes are only minor statistical upgrades, offering “+2 to melee” or “+1 to heavy melee attacks,” for example. Those are useful, but they’re numbers. Numbers aren’t fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you’re a tornado of sharp edges? That’s fun! But do you know where that skill is? Not until you stumble upon it, or just look it up online. That’s not a great experience.\n\nSecondly, these unlockable skills at the center of the clusters are more passive, or augmentation to things you can already do, rather than the cool new abilities you’d normally find in a skill tree. Granted, a lot of them are incredibly useful – vital even – but while being able to stomp on a downed enemy or control an arrow you fire from a predator bow are very useful, they’re not as impactful as being able to light your weapons on fire or kick someone off a bridge to their doom.\n\nThose game-changing new abilities are hidden throughout the world in books of knowledge, so unless you’re exploring and hunting them from the get-go, the big-ticket abilities may not end up in your arsenal for dozens of hours. Because of this, for the first 10 or 15 hours I felt like Valhalla’s combat was underwhelming next to Odyssey’s bombastic style and flair. I was eventually proven wrong, of course, and it became as flexible, fluid, and brutal as ever after I unlocked enough skills and found enough abilities. But the whole system is skewed toward the mid-to-late game, which left me feeling fangless for over a dozen hours. It just takes way too long to start adding complexity to combat. So if this isn’t your first Assassin’s Creed game, know that the initial scuffles can seem very bland hack-and-slash affairs until you’ve started discovering some tools in the open world.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Is My Axe; There Aren’t Many Like It, and This One Is Mine\nOn the other hand, I adore the new direction Ubisoft has taken inventory and quests in here. For instance, there’s far less loot in Valhalla than in Origins and Odyssey; instead of finding 400 junk-level bearded axes that you’ll inevitably sell to a merchant, Valhalla gives you different kinds of the archetypal axe, or shield, or greatsword, etc. Each weapon has a unique look, and even though two greatswords might be only slightly different statistically, they carry different passive bonuses for flavor preference. For example, one sword might do more heavy damage the more light attacks you land, while another might poison enemies you’ve not to the ground. Both are interesting, and useful, and offer you different ways to approach the same weapon style.\n\nIf you find one you like, you can invest collectible currencies to not only upgrade its level, which improves its stats, but upgrade the quality, and that often comes with a new visual appearance and always allows you to upgrade its level even further. It’s much less of a hassle and more rewarding in the long run than having to sift through two pages of greatswords, and weirdly allows me to grow more attached to them.\n\nAs a pro tip, don't sleep on the spear.\nAnd as you further augment these weapons and shields with runes, you’ll find unique combinations of attack animations depending on which hand you’re holding it in, for a nuanced system that’s so much deeper than I’d initially thought. As a pro tip, don’t sleep on the spear. I know it’s not as sexy as the big two-handed axe, but its two-handed/left-handed heavy attack lets you stick an enemy and fling them in a direction of your choosing for massive damage.\n\nThe other great change is in the greater flexibility and organic discovery of side quests and activities. Ubisoft has done away with the cascading list of side quests to track in favor of revealing colored-coded points of interest on the map for mysteries, wealth, and artifacts. Often you’ll find one of the many insane and light-hearted side stories – like one involving a crazy cat lady who happens to live next to a farmer whose field is overrun with rats (convenient!) – but it could also be a place of mystical power, a psychedelic hallucination challenge, or an ambush by bandits.\n\nThese mysteries are, more often than not, much sillier than the main storyline, even farcical at times, but there are many that hide deeply unsettling secrets and deadly encounters. The beauty of the system is you don’t know what you’re getting into, but you’re free to walk away at any time knowing that pale dot will still be there waiting for you when and if you decide to come back. Ultimately, they’re excellent quick reprieves from the darker, heavier tones of the long, multi-part main story quests, and the freedom to pick what you want to pursue without obligation keeps the elements of surprise refreshing and engaging.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \nGlitch in the Animus\nNo matter where you go in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, though, you’re sure to encounter some… let’s call them quirks. Everyone and everything here is fighting a common foe: a large number of bugs and technical hiccups that span the spectrum of hilarious, annoying, frustrating, and downright broken.\n\nI’ve run into half a dozen hard crashes that returned me to the Xbox dashboard. I’ve cursed out loud at ore deposits and door barricades that just refused to break thanks to the attack animation of whatever weapon I was holding not connecting perfectly, I guess? I’ve avoided a number of staircases that snag you halfway up and refuse to let you do the one thing they were made to do. I’ve stood perfectly still as enemies ran tight, fast circles around me, or brazenly ignored the arrows I’ve buried in their heads. I’ve ridden nitro-powered rowboats that take flight whenever you dash onto the shore, and restarted Valhalla because quest progression came to a grinding halt when a vital NPC got stuck in a river or decided to just never move to begin with. I’ve looked past lingering HUD elements that overlap or stay on screen. I’ve raged against enemy Zealots – Valhalla’s version of mercenaries – that inexplicably regained health even when I was drowning them in a river or beating them to death with my bare hands, becoming effectively immortal. And friends, I swear to you, I’ve seen a flying whale.\n\nNo matter where you go in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, though, you're sure to encounter some… let's call them quirks.\n\nLastly, I don’t know if this is a bug or just a result of the developers wanting you to be able to do cool aerial attacks, but the fact you can survive a 100-foot fall by performing an attack in mid-air seems like the former. I’m not complaining, it helps speed up getting from point A to point B when I don’t want to look for a safe landing space, but it’s just so odd.\n\nAnyway, you get it. Valhalla is buggy – really buggy. That said, it wasn’t overpowering; looking back after over 60 hours played, all those nagging issues feel like small footnotes in what’s otherwise been many great hours of exploration and discovery. And, in the moment, I think it’s easy to miss out on the forest for the trees. So while I may never forget that flying whale, it’s not the first, or second, or even tenth thing I think about when I think of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Verdict\n\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is a big, bold, and ridiculously beautiful entry to the series that finally delivers on the much-requested era of the Viking and the messy, political melting pot of England’s Dark Ages. It walks a fine line between historical tourism, top-shelf conspiracy theory, and veiled mysticism against the backdrop of a grounded and focused story. Fresh takes on several of the series’ established loot and quest systems help to keep the things fluid and nuanced, though progression could use refinement. There’s also a bigger than usual horde of bugs and blemishes to contend with from start to finish. But while it may not be the most stylish or polished, its rugged and brutal look at the muddy business of Scandanavian expansion is as memorable and dense as an Assassin’s Creed has ever been, and it makes great use of the new consoles\n\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n    )\n\n\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport './Footer.css';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <div className='footer-container'>\n      <section className='footer-subscription'>\n        <p className='footer-subscription-heading'>\n        You can always contact me on social media or my personal G-Mail\n        </p>\n        <p className='footer-subscription-text'>\n            bharatekarhade@gmail.com\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section class='social-media'>\n        <div class='social-media-wrap'>\n          <div class='footer-logo'>\n            <Link to='/' className='social-logo'>\n            <i class=\"fas fa-code\"></i>\n            <p> code/game </p>\n            <i class=\"fas fa-gamepad\"></i>\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n          <div class='social-icons'>\n            <a href = \"https://www.facebook.com/bharatbhushan.karhade\" \n            target= \"_blank\"\n            className = \"social-icon-link facebook\" aria-label = 'Facebook'>\n              <i class='fab fa-facebook-f' />\n              </a>\n            \n              <a href = \"https://www.instagram.com/mrm3anor\" \n            target= \"_blank\"\n            className = \"social-icon-link instagram\" aria-label = 'Instagram'>\n              <i class='fab fa-instagram' />\n            </a>\n            <a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaqnSwav0t1NwhEUDniBgqg\" \n            target= \"_blank\"\n            className = \"social-icon-link youtube\" aria-label = 'Youtube'>\n              <i class='fab fa-youtube' />\n            </a>\n            <a href = \"https://www.twitter.com/bharatkarhade\" \n            target= \"_blank\"\n            className = \"social-icon-link twitter\" aria-label = 'Twitter'>\n              <i class='fab fa-twitter' />\n            </a>\n            <a href = \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharatbh\" \n            target= \"_blank\"\n            className = \"social-icon-link linkedin\" aria-label = 'Linkedin'>\n              <i class='fab fa-linkedin' />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./Post.css\";\n\nexport default function Post() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"singlePost\">\n        <div className=\"singlePostWrapper\">\n        <img\n          className=\"singlePostImg\"\n          src=\"./images/Game1.webp\"\n          alt=\"\"\n        />\n          <h1 className=\"singlePostTitle\">\n            Rainbow Six Siege\n            \n          </h1>\n\n          <p className=\"singlePostDesc\">\n          <span className=\"hightlight\"> When I boot up Rainbow Six Siege today, I’m playing a completely different game than the one Ubisoft released in 2015. After three years and change, there isn’t a part of the tactical multiplayer shooter that hasn’t been chopped and screwed. The operators, weapons, menus, servers, destruction — nothing has been deemed untouchable in the eyes of both its developers and its fans. In 2019, Siege is one of the finest multiplayer experiences around. But even folks who don’t play the game can appreciate how it carved a new path for the sustainability of AAA games, and for the possibilities of cooperation between developers and fan communities.\n\n            There’s a lot that keeps me coming back to Siege after over 1,000 hours, thanks to a near-constant drip of new tweaks and additions. Every few months, Ubisoft drops two operators that shake up the game’s malleable meta. Alongside them, we get additional tools and environmental challenges: one-way mirrors, laser drones, holograms, spike traps. Content is delivered on a strictly scheduled roadmap that gives me a sense that my investment in the game is matched by its creators.\n            </span>\n\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <span className=\"highlight\">\n            Siege has come a long way since it launched two years ago (read our original Rainbow Six Siege review). A steady stream of new maps, operators, and cosmetic items - along with a heaping helping of bug fixes, balance changes, and stability improvements - have slowly transformed it into a much deeper competitive game, even if there are some growing pains that come along with that. Siege has always been a fun and challenging FPS, but as it enters its third year it has gained a pull that’s become hard to resist.\n\n\nThe core of Siege hasn’t changed; a 5v5 dance of attack and defense between well-equipped military special forces squads on compact but complex maps. A wonderful emphasis on strategy and smart play over pure twitch aiming gives it a distinct feel that you don’t get from games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Often times figuring out which door to barricade and which to break open can win you more games than just being able to outgun your opponents.\n</span>\n<br />\n<br />\n<span className=\"highlight2\">Learning which door to barricade can win you more games than just outgunning your opponent.</span> \n<br />\n<br />\n\nEach round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled drones. It’s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious, Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of as much information as possible. It’s only a minute long, but there are a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great.\n\nMost of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They’re also littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn’t get any better.\n\n\nThere are currently 15 maps in the casual matchmaking queue, only nine of which are in ranked, each visually distinct and set in different locations across the globe, which results in a fantastic amount of variety every time I sit down to play. I love that I often won’t see the same map twice in an evening of games, but the flipside is that it takes longer to actually learn the layouts of those maps. Still, it’s a tradeoff that ultimately improves Siege.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nTalking the Talk\nWorking with your teammates, either through voice chat, text, or just map markers and pings is a simple but extremely impactful thing you can do to get better at Siege. It can be a big ask to rely on the voices of internet strangers (and Siege definitely has its fair share of unfriendly and unhelpful players) but overall I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how this community understands and embraces good communication as a tool.\n\nA great example of how communication can win games is with security cameras and drones. You can use cameras to mark the location of enemies for your whole team, but doing so will also warn the marked player that they’ve been seen, often resulting in them quickly hunting down and destroying that camera. But if you don’t mark enemies, and instead talk to your teammates and tell them where that person is, you can give them the same information without alerting your opponent. You can still use those same cameras after you’ve died too, which cleverly cuts out a lot of down-time as you continue to help any surviving teammates.\n\n\nOf course, you’ll still run into plenty of people mindlessly tagging with cameras in public matchmaking. Like many competitive games, Siege is almost always more fun when played with friends I can comfortably coordinate with. Timing breaches and calling out flash grenades will let you get the drop on a defending team, but the short two to three-minute rounds and setup period between those tense moments also leaves room for goofing off in between.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nBringing the grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble, so plan carefully.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\nSiege has just three PvP game modes, all of which revolve around one team protecting a room (or two rooms, in the case of the Bomb mode) and the other team trying to break through their defenses. They are different enough in subtle ways that influence what walls you want to reinforce or which operators you should use - for example, bringing the blind grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble - but the general approach either team takes in a given mode can feel a little too similar.\n\nAs a side activity to the competitive battles there’s the PvE Terrorist Hunt mode and the single-player Situations. Both of these modes are great, and I often find myself warming up for PvP by taking on the AI first. The Situations are runs through the same multiplayer maps against AI, and can feel as compelling as a fully built-out single-player mission at times, which makes it a bit disappointing that we haven’t seen any new ones as everything else grows around it. (The first season of year three begins in March, and is expected to add a new kind of PvE mode called Outbreak, which will hopefully be a bit of what I’m hoping for.)\n\nRole Call\nAnother way Siege has grown is its ever-expanding cast of Operators. Sixteen new characters have been added so far, which makes a current total of 36 with eight more coming in the next year. The result is more dynamic and varied matches, both in how you play and who you have to play against. Unlike the maps, it’s much easier to remember what each operator does, which helps the large roster not feel daunting to learn. You only really have to keep track of their special ability and what type of gun they might be using, but they’re still unique enough to leave ample room for different playstyles and strategies.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\nEvery Rainbow Six Siege Operator (Year 1 and 2)\n\nSAS Attacker - Sledge (base game)\n\nSAS Attacker - Thatcher (base game)\n\nSAS Defender - Smoke (base game)\n\nSAS Defender - Mute (base game)\n\nSWAT Attacker - Ash (base game)\n\nSWAT Attacker - Thermite (base game)\n<br />\n<br />\n\nAn operator like Mira completely changes the landscape of a map when picked, with the ability to put impenetrable one-way mirrors into otherwise solid walls. Other operators like Caveira, who can silence her footsteps and then interrogate downed enemies to learn the position of their teammates, or Vigil, who can become invisible to cameras and drones, are built to be played as aggressive, roaming defenders. Their presence enables new strategies that simply weren’t as viable at launch. Abilities like this have changed Siege in very real ways, and the increased options keep Siege from ever feeling repetitive.\n\nBetter still, the benefit of that variety can be felt even if you don’t have these new operators unlocked for yourself. I didn’t necessarily feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any given character, as very few operators in Siege feel like either “must picks” or completely underpowered. I wished I could use certain locked operators, sure, but the 20 base operators that have been there from the beginning are still strong, fun, and varied enough to make the significantly higher Renown cost (Siege’s in-game currency) of any that came after them less frustrating.\n\nYou don’t start with any Operators unlocked, with the original 20 costing between 500 and 2,500 Renown, a relatively small amount that comes quickly enough from playing matches. All the new operators, however, are a massive 25,000. It can take at least 20 hours of play (on the low-end) to gather that much renown, but you also have the option to buy operators with real money for $5 a pop.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\nWith only eight released in a year, 25,000 renown isn’t so hard to collect for regular players who have kept up to date, but it’s pretty steep for newcomers who are trying to catch up. Siege does feel like it has been set up to encourage players to spend real money on its year-long passes, which provide every new operator released in their given time period (plus some extra premium currency and other goodies) for $30. It’s akin to an annual subscription fee, but nearly everything but some premium cosmetics can be earned without spending any money beyond buying the base game.\n\nIt's disappointing that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped in price since their release.\n“\nThat said, I’m disappointed that the Year-One operators haven’t dropped in price since their release. The Year-One and Year-Two passes have both left the store, and the one option to get them cheaper is a slightly discounted bundle only available for real money. I’d love to see these older operators drop to a Renown cost to make them more inviting to new players once their release hype has long passed.\n\nThe store, in general, suffers from growing pains that Siege has yet to address. A massive amount of cosmetic gun skins, gun charms, and operator outfits are available, with new ones arriving as often as weekly. Nearly all of these cosmetics can be unlocked with Renown, and some of them are extremely cool. The gun skins, in particular, tend to be varied and gorgeous, everything from being textured like gems to having detailed tigers stretching up the barrel. Many of the most recent operator outfits and headgear options have started branching into cool and creative territory beyond just different shades of camo, like Valkyrie’s Pop Art make-up or Blackbeard’s dapper top hat.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the store itself has become a big pile of stuff that’s nearly impossible to navigate. It’s hard to browse and hard to search, especially when it comes to bundles. Items will helpfully tell you if they are available in a bundle, but there’s no way to then go to that bundle directly, and the bundles tab is an ungodly long text list with a single image to explain everything that’s in it.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\nSiege wisely keeps the items in its store away from anything that really affects gameplay. There are a variety of gun scopes and barrel attachments that can be unlocked with Renown that do offer mid-match advantages, but they are cheap enough that this power boost never felt walled off or like it was compromising balance.\n\nAnd, once again, what your gun looks like and the scope you are using can mean next to nothing if your opponent can simply outthink you. Siege has continued to double down on that focus on smart play over the years, and it’s made it a game I want to keep playing for a long time to come. Looking forward, Ubisoft has already laid out a free update plan for Siege’s third year, including eight more operators, two new maps, and the Outbreak game mode, meaning things don’t show any sign of slowing down.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n    )\n\n\n}","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./Post.css\";\nimport Linkify from 'react-linkify';\nexport default function Project() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"singlePost\">\n        <div className=\"singlePostWrapper\">\n        <img\n          className=\"singlePostImg1\"\n          src=\"./images/react&django.png\"\n          alt=\"\"\n        />\n          <h1 className=\"singlePostTitle\">\n            Party Controller\n            \n          </h1>\n\n          <p className=\"singlePostDesc\">\n            Few months ago I started exploring the world of development, lots of things to learn Webdevelopment, Appdevelopment,\n            Cryptocurrency, and a lot more. Tried few things but the thing that struct me most is WedD I mean such a beautiful technology it is.\n            One can learn some basic things(html,css) and then could pick a framework and little explore is what all needed to build a website,\n            no need to find a professional to build our website we can create on our own.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            I wanted to learn one frontend and one backend framework and the sheer amount of option I had was astonishing, after lot of reaserach and\n            seeing how both work I picked <span className =\"highlight\">React-Frontend</span> and <span className = \"highlight\">Django-Backend </span>\n            as my route. Went to there website learned few thing how to start project how to save models or if it is react how to route pages. And now I wanted\n            to build something of me using the things I have learned, but I was hit with a hurdle <span className = \"highlight1\">How to connect React-fronted with Django-Backend </span>.\n            Took me lot of time as to how to do this things and I got introduced to DjangoRest-Framework, what this essentially is this allows frontend to communicate\n            react based front end app with Django Backend saw some tutorials and I wa ready to make start.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            What I wanted to do was to create Party-Music Controller. What it is? So it is a wesbsite where user can make there specific rooms with the sepcific settings\n            and an unique code for the room. What does the room do? So room has multiple propertied like 1)Is it onlt guest who can play/pause song 2)How many votes should be there\n            to skip a song like this. So host can have acces to the room properties and can change any number of people can join the room and they could vore as to skip the song or not,\n            if number of votes get equal to No of votes needed to skip the song then the song would be skipped.\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <Linkify>Go to project github Repo https://github.com/BHARATBHUSHAN9923/Party_Music</Linkify>\n    \n     \n\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n    )\n\n\n}","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./Post.css\";\nimport './AboutMe.css'\n\nexport default function Services() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"singlePost\">\n        <div className=\"singlePostWrapper\">\n        <img\n          className=\"singlePostImg\"\n          src=\"./images/MyCollege.jpg\"\n          alt=\"\"\n        />\n        <img className=\"wrapper\" src=\"./images/Me.jpeg\" alt = \"\">\n\n        </img>\n          <h1 className=\"singlePostTitle\">\n            About Me\n          </h1>\n\n          <p className=\"singlePostDesc\">\n           Hello, my name is <span className=\"highlight\">Bharatbhushan Karhade </span> currently pursuing <span className=\"highlight\">B.Tech</span> from\n           <span className=\"highlight\"> Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</span>.\n\n            <br />\n            <br />\n           I love to <span className=\"highlight\" > Code </span> and <span className=\"highlight\"> Game </span>, and always looking for a chance to learn something new new.\n           I grew up in a small town in <span className=\"highlight\">Maharshtra, India</span>, and has spent most of school and college life in hostels in short I know\n           hot micromanage.
