Though Ubisoft has dug up some of its stealth-action roots to make that style more appealing, Valhalla\u2019s focus is on the absolutely massive recreation of Dark Ages England, brought to life with stunning beauty and a level of detail I\u2019ve rarely seen. It\u2019s been an impressive showcase for the Xbox Series X (and presumably the PlayStation 5, but Ubisoft only gave us access to the Xbox version ahead of launch), playing in 4K and a near-constant 60 frames per second. You have to put up with some new progression system ideas that don\u2019t quite deliver, and an abundance of bugs, but there\u2019s a staggering number of things to do, explore, and discover in and around Valhalla\u2019s more atmospheric storytelling. Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u2019s story follows Eivor, a male or female Norse Viking who grows up with a chip on their shoulder and vengeance in their heart after some particularly dastardly events in the opening cinematic. From those starting moments, the table is set and soon you and your brother Sigurd are off on a grand adventure to England, a land ripe with wealth and glory, and already well-integrated with Danes and Norse from years of Viking invasion and conquest. That sets the stage for your arrival in England as you settle the land and forge alliances to protect and expand your fledgling homestead against the chaos and political dust storm of warring factions across England\u2019s four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria, and Wessex.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"The last time Assassin\u2019s Creed tried letting us choose to play as a male or female protagonist the results were hit or miss, especially on the male side. Here, however, the performances of both the male and female versions of Eivor are admirable, though some accents drift a bit. (At one point I could\u2019ve sworn female Eivor made a stop in Boston from the way she crushed the word \u201charbor,\u201d but quickly enough it was back to Norse normal.) These brief moments are absolutely the exception to the otherwise steady and earnest delivery throughout, which is also true of most of the main characters. Outside the main cast, though some random NPCs can be a little\u2026 much. But special mention goes out to Sigurd, who channels fiery intensity and flirts with crazy in his performances, and that performance is accentuated by fascinating facial expressions that often lean uncomfortably close to the latter. The siblings' quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect. Even so, the siblings\u2019 quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect. There are moments throughout where the griefstriken, bittersweet, and just plain bitter resolutions reminded me of The Witcher 3\u2019s Bloody Baron delivery. This is a dirty, dingy world where life is cheap and nearly everyone is scratching and clawing to gain power \u2013 or to keep it \u2013 regardless of who gets burned along the way.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"One particular instance found me helping the leader of a nearby shire \u2013 regions within the four kingdoms (no hobbits) \u2013 who had discovered a traitor in her inner circle and charged me with rooting them out because she loved each one of them as family and couldn\u2019t trust herself to see past their lies. The resulting few hours of investigation brought me to the end of the road, and I made the best decision based on the available information I had. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure I was right; I still don\u2019t know. If the person I accused was guilty, Valhalla never gave me more clarity, and the uncertainty seems very intentional. My judgment was accepted and the consequences were swiftly doled out, and that was that. I\u2019ve found myself thinking about that decision ever since. But that\u2019s the business of eighth-century England, I suppose. A World Separated by an Ocean Valhalla\u2019s vast interpretation of The Dark Ages of Britain is massive, and when coupled with a significant portion of Norway, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla presents a staggeringly large playground through which you ply your trade. And no matter where you are, it\u2019s absolutely stunning. Beyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u2019s England is in turmoil. It\u2019s home to clashes between Danes, Norse, Saxons, Britons, Picts, and more, all of whom have stuck a claim in one hunk of rock or another and will kill you to defend it \u2013 or to take it, depending on which side of the fence you happen to land on. It\u2019s a confusing mess of integration that creates an excellent social and political knot into which to tie this story, compounded by cultural and religious elements that really drive a sense of otherness in the many different regions, even if they\u2019re just down the river.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"But as all Assassin\u2019s Creed games do, the undercurrent of Assassins versus the Order of the Ancients runs everywhere. It\u2019s well represented in the various factions, and even in the decaying bones of the Roman Empire whose structures and architecture not only litter every region, but serve as excellent places to delve into the necessary long-forgotten tombs, crypts, and subterranean structures the series needs to hide its ancient order secrets. Again, that\u2019s similar to Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, but much of the legwork of hunting down The Order is optional outside the main antagonists that inject themselves into your tale and force that storyline. Beyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin's Creed Valhalla's England is in turmoil. In fact, the Assassin\u2019s Brotherhood elements that rope Eivor in start softly, slowly weaving in and out of their story with admirable restraint before the usual Dan-Brown-ification picks up and reveals everything is touched by these organizations in one form or another. But the focus rarely shifts completely from the Eivor\u2019s more-engaging efforts to build a network of alliances throughout England\u2019s four kingdoms and its many, many shires. One final note before we move on, without spoiling anything: as a huge fan of mythology, I\u2019m stupidly excited for everyone to see Ubisoft\u2019s interpretation of the Norse pantheon and Asgard. Tackling something so mystical and otherworldly had to be tough, but the end result is a more \u201crealistic\u201d and granular take on it than you\u2019d be used to if your familiarity revolves around the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comic books. That\u2019s not a slight on either, just an acknowledgement that this is a refreshing change of pace, especially considering how insane Norse mythology is when you get into the weeds. To Go A Viking Many of Valhalla\u2019s consistent high points come as you live the life of a stereotypical Viking. Aboard your customizable longship, you\u2019ll sail along snaking rivers and lead your clan in raids against the gold-swollen churches and monasteries of England, bloated with supplies and materials needed to build your new settlement that then acts as your homebase and quest hub. The pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray. Even after so many hours, I\u2019ve yet to grow tired of blowing the horn as we approach the shore, and running up the hill as imposing stone steeples adorned in crosses and decoration tower over. It\u2019s a welcome distraction from longer and more involved quest chains, and provides a quick hit of combat serotonin when you just need to bury your axe in something.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"The pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray. Like many wars of that time, eventually you\u2019re going to have to siege a castle or fortress, and that\u2019s where Valhalla really cranks up the medievalness. These mass assaults often serve as the payoffs for longer quest chains, pitting your armies against whatever upstart king, jarl, or noble calls themselves lord of the lands you aim to conquer. These battles are fever-pitched and chaotic, and while they\u2019re often impressive to look at they usually require a small checklist of orderly tasks to complete: ram the gates to smithereens, breach the inner keep, and kill the despot at the center. After a few of these you can start to pick up the patterns, but often they involve scouting defenses and softening up the opposition before going in, so that adds an element of strategy to it even if it eventually boils down to you taking on the big bad guy at the end. Still, breaking through fortifications with siege weaponry and working toward the inner keep is a very cool spectacle and captures the grandeur of all-out warfare that\u2019s befitting a story of conquering kingdoms. But when you\u2019re done pillaging on your raid or shoring up an alliance with the new ruler you\u2019ve installed, it\u2019s time to spend those supplies and raw materials. For that we return to the Settlement, a place to invest your resources that serves not only as your quest hub, but as a separate layer of progression with tangible benefits. As you begin to build out your settlement you\u2019ll construct vital locations like a merchant to quickly buy and sell goods, a barracks to recruit and hand-pick your raiding party, a stable to buy mounts and upgrade riding abilities, a blacksmith to upgrade weapons and armor, and much, much more. On the surface, these are welcome additions and giving you stake of land to handle your business definitely beats tracking down merchants in the big wide world. It\u2019s a little bastion of productivity that you\u2019ll revisit again and again, and serves as the welcome \u201ccome home\u201d location where you\u2019ll plan your campaign across England, and dive into side character backstories and storylines. I'd love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay. At first, the settlement had me excited, because I love a good management experience \u2013 especially when everything offers some kind of reward to further power my character. Eventually, though, as upgrades and management started to slow down and shifted away from unlocking cool new things to getting statistical bonuses, the allure of my settlement began to dwindle and I found myself spending less on my building plans and more time just getting my shopping done before I went out to discover new interesting things. To be fair, there are strong elements at play in your settlement \u2013 like the shopkeepers and characters that live and work there which you\u2019ll get to know and potentially care about \u2013 but I hope it\u2019s a mechanic that Ubisoft continues to flesh it out in future Assassin\u2019s Creeds entries because I\u2019d love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay to make me want to spend time there for reasons other than a trade and quest depot.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"So, You Want to Be an Assassin? Since Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins, Ubisoft has continued to transplant the series from the stealth-action genre to the more wider appealing open-world action RPG landscape. It\u2019s a change that I\u2019ve personally really enjoyed, since a big, immersive open-world loaded with oddities and things to do punches my ticket. But it\u2019s come with the completely fair criticism that, when you carry the existing brand into new territory, it can alienate existing fans of the series that really miss and expect that subtle, nuanced gameplay of getting in, making the kill, and getting out without being seen. The stat-driven RPG nature of this new era of Assassin\u2019s Creed games has made this next to impossible because assassinations are subject to leashed power based on your enemy\u2019s level and your overall effectiveness at dealing backstab-y damage. So unless you\u2019re building into your stealth and assassination styles heavily, and trying to backstab enemies around your same level, odds are that when you stick them with the pointy end they take a ton of damage but don\u2019t actually die, and have to be finished off with a decidedly un-stealthy battle. I can see how that\u2019s frustrating for anybody who misses that kind of gameplay \u2013 especially since the series continues to trend toward emphasizing combat. Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, to Ubisoft\u2019s credit, attempts to keep one foot on both sides, and it mostly succeeds thanks to a number of options that allow you to dial in your preferred style of play. The \u201cvanilla\u201d answer to this problem is in the skill tree. So if you play on the default difficulty, and default stealth difficulty (more on that in a minute), you can find ways to get closer to the original Assassin\u2019s Creed style without going into the options menu. Specifically, there\u2019s a skill called Advanced Assassination that allows you to overcome enemy level difference and power imbalance as long as you hit the quick-time event prompt. I love this approach, personally, because it puts the onus on you to perform and seal the deal if your timing is right. If it\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re going to pay for it when the big Viking turns on you and the alarm bells sound off. That\u2019s the definition of a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. If that\u2019s still not close enough to home, you\u2019re in luck, because there\u2019s an outside gameplay tool in the options menu called Guaranteed Assassination that allows you to assassinate ALL enemies in one shot, regardless of level, every time. However, it does come with the following note: \u201cPlease note that when choosing this option, you are not playing the game as it was intended to be experienced.\u201d So, take that as you will (it\u2019ll probably lead to some missions being laughably easy) but know that it\u2019s there. Finally, if you really want to dial in your assassination experience, you\u2019ve got some control over the difficulty settings to get you there. Just as you turn on Guaranteed Assassinations for that old-school feel, you can independently crank the combat difficulty up as far as you can stand it in order to punish yourself for getting caught. And you can tailor the stealth difficulty as well, which manipulates a number of factors in the stealth system to allow for an easier or harder approach. So there you go. If you\u2019ve been on the \u201cIt\u2019s not an Assassin\u2019s Creed game anymore\u201d train, Valhalla has a number of stops for you to hop off at should you take a detour through the options menu.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Trying Things Out While Valhalla faithfully sticks to the open-world script of Origins and Odyssey, there are some new systems in play, for better and worse. This time around, skill progression and abilities have been decoupled, meaning you no longer gain cool new abilities automatically simply through leveling up. In fact, the entire level system is effectively gone. Though you still earn experience, and it\u2019s still cached at steady intervals to reward you with skill points, you don\u2019t gain levels in the traditional format. Those skills points you earn are spent on the Skill Tree, which is more of a web, linking various clusters of unlockable upgrades into constellations that you work your way through along the three main regions: combat, stealth, and ranged. On paper it\u2019s a good system, and slightly reminiscent of Skyrim in style, but for me it\u2019s ultimately a step backward, for two reasons. First, while you\u2019ll know which direction to invest in from the start depending on what pillar you want to go toward first, once you\u2019ve unlocked the skill at the center of the cluster you\u2019ve got to decide which direction to move from there. Do you work toward the left, to the right? Normally you\u2019d likely take a look at the skills further down the tree and figure out where you want to end up, but that\u2019s the rub: every neighboring cluster is hidden by fog until you spend the necessary points to unlock the node that connects one cluster to another. What this means is you don\u2019t know what the skill in the next group is going to be until you spend a few points to head that direction. That\u2019s really frustrating early on, when you sink your valuable early points only to reveal a skill you don\u2019t care about. Numbers aren't fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you're a tornado of sharp edges? That's fun! \u201cBut there\u2019s still value in the smaller nodes between the main skills in each constellation,\u201d you might say, being technically correct. And that\u2019s true. But these nodes are only minor statistical upgrades, offering \u201c+2 to melee\u201d or \u201c+1 to heavy melee attacks,\u201d for example. Those are useful, but they\u2019re numbers. Numbers aren\u2019t fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you\u2019re a tornado of sharp edges? That\u2019s fun! But do you know where that skill is? Not until you stumble upon it, or just look it up online. That\u2019s not a great experience. Secondly, these unlockable skills at the center of the clusters are more passive, or augmentation to things you can already do, rather than the cool new abilities you\u2019d normally find in a skill tree. Granted, a lot of them are incredibly useful \u2013 vital even \u2013 but while being able to stomp on a downed enemy or control an arrow you fire from a predator bow are very useful, they\u2019re not as impactful as being able to light your weapons on fire or kick someone off a bridge to their doom. Those game-changing new abilities are hidden throughout the world in books of knowledge, so unless you\u2019re exploring and hunting them from the get-go, the big-ticket abilities may not end up in your arsenal for dozens of hours. Because of this, for the first 10 or 15 hours I felt like Valhalla\u2019s combat was underwhelming next to Odyssey\u2019s bombastic style and flair. I was eventually proven wrong, of course, and it became as flexible, fluid, and brutal as ever after I unlocked enough skills and found enough abilities. But the whole system is skewed toward the mid-to-late game, which left me feeling fangless for over a dozen hours. It just takes way too long to start adding complexity to combat. So if this isn\u2019t your first Assassin\u2019s Creed game, know that the initial scuffles can seem very bland hack-and-slash affairs until you\u2019ve started discovering some tools in the open world.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"This Is My Axe; There Aren\u2019t Many Like It, and This One Is Mine On the other hand, I adore the new direction Ubisoft has taken inventory and quests in here. For instance, there\u2019s far less loot in Valhalla than in Origins and Odyssey; instead of finding 400 junk-level bearded axes that you\u2019ll inevitably sell to a merchant, Valhalla gives you different kinds of the archetypal axe, or shield, or greatsword, etc. Each weapon has a unique look, and even though two greatswords might be only slightly different statistically, they carry different passive bonuses for flavor preference. For example, one sword might do more heavy damage the more light attacks you land, while another might poison enemies you\u2019ve not to the ground. Both are interesting, and useful, and offer you different ways to approach the same weapon style. If you find one you like, you can invest collectible currencies to not only upgrade its level, which improves its stats, but upgrade the quality, and that often comes with a new visual appearance and always allows you to upgrade its level even further. It\u2019s much less of a hassle and more rewarding in the long run than having to sift through two pages of greatswords, and weirdly allows me to grow more attached to them. As a pro tip, don't sleep on the spear. And as you further augment these weapons and shields with runes, you\u2019ll find unique combinations of attack animations depending on which hand you\u2019re holding it in, for a nuanced system that\u2019s so much deeper than I\u2019d initially thought. As a pro tip, don\u2019t sleep on the spear. I know it\u2019s not as sexy as the big two-handed axe, but its two-handed/left-handed heavy attack lets you stick an enemy and fling them in a direction of your choosing for massive damage. The other great change is in the greater flexibility and organic discovery of side quests and activities. Ubisoft has done away with the cascading list of side quests to track in favor of revealing colored-coded points of interest on the map for mysteries, wealth, and artifacts. Often you\u2019ll find one of the many insane and light-hearted side stories \u2013 like one involving a crazy cat lady who happens to live next to a farmer whose field is overrun with rats (convenient!) \u2013 but it could also be a place of mystical power, a psychedelic hallucination challenge, or an ambush by bandits. These mysteries are, more often than not, much sillier than the main storyline, even farcical at times, but there are many that hide deeply unsettling secrets and deadly encounters. The beauty of the system is you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into, but you\u2019re free to walk away at any time knowing that pale dot will still be there waiting for you when and if you decide to come back. Ultimately, they\u2019re excellent quick reprieves from the darker, heavier tones of the long, multi-part main story quests, and the freedom to pick what you want to pursue without obligation keeps the elements of surprise refreshing and engaging.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Glitch in the Animus No matter where you go in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, though, you\u2019re sure to encounter some\u2026 let\u2019s call them quirks.

I\u2019ve cursed out loud at ore deposits and door barricades that just refused to break thanks to the attack animation of whatever weapon I was holding not connecting perfectly, I guess? I\u2019ve avoided a number of staircases that snag you halfway up and refuse to let you do the one thing they were made to do.

Lastly, I don\u2019t know if this is a bug or just a result of the developers wanting you to be able to do cool aerial attacks, but the fact you can survive a 100-foot fall by performing an attack in mid-air seems like the former. I\u2019m not complaining, it helps speed up getting from point A to point B when I don\u2019t want to look for a safe landing space, but it\u2019s just so odd. Anyway, you get it.

That said, it wasn\u2019t overpowering; looking back after over 60 hours played, all those nagging issues feel like small footnotes in what\u2019s otherwise been many great hours of exploration and discovery.

The operators, weapons, menus, servers, destruction \u2014 nothing has been deemed untouchable in the eyes of both its developers and its fans. In 2019, Siege is one of the finest multiplayer experiences around. But even folks who don\u2019t play the game can appreciate how it carved a new path for the sustainability of AAA games, and for the possibilities of cooperation between developers and fan communities. There\u2019s a lot that keeps me coming back to Siege after over 1,000 hours, thanks to a near-constant drip of new tweaks and additions. Every few months, Ubisoft drops two operators that shake up the game\u2019s malleable meta. Alongside them, we get additional tools and environmental challenges: one-way mirrors, laser drones, holograms, spike traps.

A steady stream of new maps, operators, and cosmetic items - along with a heaping helping of bug fixes, balance changes, and stability improvements - have slowly transformed it into a much deeper competitive game, even if there are some growing pains that come along with that. Siege has always been a fun and challenging FPS, but as it enters its third year it has gained a pull that\u2019s become hard to resist. The core of Siege hasn\u2019t changed; a 5v5 dance of attack and defense between well-equipped military special forces squads on compact but complex maps. A wonderful emphasis on strategy and smart play over pure twitch aiming gives it a distinct feel that you don\u2019t get from games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Often times figuring out which door to barricade and which to break open can win you more games than just being able to outgun your opponents."}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("span",{className:"highlight2",children:"Learning which door to barricade can win you more games than just outgunning your opponent."}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Each round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled drones. It\u2019s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious, Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of as much information as possible. It\u2019s only a minute long, but there are a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great. Most of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They\u2019re also littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn\u2019t get any better. There are currently 15 maps in the casual matchmaking queue, only nine of which are in ranked, each visually distinct and set in different locations across the globe, which results in a fantastic amount of variety every time I sit down to play. I love that I often won\u2019t see the same map twice in an evening of games, but the flipside is that it takes longer to actually learn the layouts of those maps. Still, it\u2019s a tradeoff that ultimately improves Siege.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Talking the Talk Working with your teammates, either through voice chat, text, or just map markers and pings is a simple but extremely impactful thing you can do to get better at Siege. It can be a big ask to rely on the voices of internet strangers (and Siege definitely has its fair share of unfriendly and unhelpful players) but overall I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by how this community understands and embraces good communication as a tool. A great example of how communication can win games is with security cameras and drones. You can use cameras to mark the location of enemies for your whole team, but doing so will also warn the marked player that they\u2019ve been seen, often resulting in them quickly hunting down and destroying that camera. But if you don\u2019t mark enemies, and instead talk to your teammates and tell them where that person is, you can give them the same information without alerting your opponent. You can still use those same cameras after you\u2019ve died too, which cleverly cuts out a lot of down-time as you continue to help any surviving teammates. Of course, you\u2019ll still run into plenty of people mindlessly tagging with cameras in public matchmaking. Like many competitive games, Siege is almost always more fun when played with friends I can comfortably coordinate with. Timing breaches and calling out flash grenades will let you get the drop on a defending team, but the short two to three-minute rounds and setup period between those tense moments also leaves room for goofing off in between.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Bringing the grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble, so plan carefully.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Siege has just three PvP game modes, all of which revolve around one team protecting a room (or two rooms, in the case of the Bomb mode) and the other team trying to break through their defenses. They are different enough in subtle ways that influence what walls you want to reinforce or which operators you should use - for example, bringing the blind grenade-spraying Fuze into a Hostage situation is asking for trouble - but the general approach either team takes in a given mode can feel a little too similar. As a side activity to the competitive battles there\u2019s the PvE Terrorist Hunt mode and the single-player Situations. Both of these modes are great, and I often find myself warming up for PvP by taking on the AI first. The Situations are runs through the same multiplayer maps against AI, and can feel as compelling as a fully built-out single-player mission at times, which makes it a bit disappointing that we haven\u2019t seen any new ones as everything else grows around it. (The first season of year three begins in March, and is expected to add a new kind of PvE mode called Outbreak, which will hopefully be a bit of what I\u2019m hoping for.) Role Call Another way Siege has grown is its ever-expanding cast of Operators. Sixteen new characters have been added so far, which makes a current total of 36 with eight more coming in the next year. The result is more dynamic and varied matches, both in how you play and who you have to play against. Unlike the maps, it\u2019s much easier to remember what each operator does, which helps the large roster not feel daunting to learn. You only really have to keep track of their special ability and what type of gun they might be using, but they\u2019re still unique enough to leave ample room for different playstyles and strategies.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Every Rainbow Six Siege Operator (Year 1 and 2) SAS Attacker - Sledge (base game) SAS Attacker - Thatcher (base game) SAS Defender - Smoke (base game) SAS Defender - Mute (base game) SWAT Attacker - Ash (base game) SWAT Attacker - Thermite (base game)",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"An operator like Mira completely changes the landscape of a map when picked, with the ability to put impenetrable one-way mirrors into otherwise solid walls. Other operators like Caveira, who can silence her footsteps and then interrogate downed enemies to learn the position of their teammates, or Vigil, who can become invisible to cameras and drones, are built to be played as aggressive, roaming defenders. Their presence enables new strategies that simply weren\u2019t as viable at launch. Abilities like this have changed Siege in very real ways, and the increased options keep Siege from ever feeling repetitive. Better still, the benefit of that variety can be felt even if you don\u2019t have these new operators unlocked for yourself. I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any given character, as very few operators in Siege feel like either \u201cmust picks\u201d or completely underpowered. I wished I could use certain locked operators, sure, but the 20 base operators that have been there from the beginning are still strong, fun, and varied enough to make the significantly higher Renown cost (Siege\u2019s in-game currency) of any that came after them less frustrating. You don\u2019t start with any Operators unlocked, with the original 20 costing between 500 and 2,500 Renown, a relatively small amount that comes quickly enough from playing matches. All the new operators, however, are a massive 25,000.

Siege does feel like it has been set up to encourage players to spend real money on its year-long passes, which provide every new operator released in their given time period (plus some extra premium currency and other goodies) for $30. It\u2019s akin to an annual subscription fee, but nearly everything but some premium cosmetics can be earned without spending any money beyond buying the base game. It's disappointing that the Year-One operators haven\u2019t dropped in price since their release. \u201c That said, I\u2019m disappointed that the Year-One operators haven\u2019t dropped in price since their release. The Year-One and Year-Two passes have both left the store, and the one option to get them cheaper is a slightly discounted bundle only available for real money. I\u2019d love to see these older operators drop to a Renown cost to make them more inviting to new players once their release hype has long passed. The store, in general, suffers from growing pains that Siege has yet to address. A massive amount of cosmetic gun skins, gun charms, and operator outfits are available, with new ones arriving as often as weekly. Nearly all of these cosmetics can be unlocked with Renown, and some of them are extremely cool. The gun skins, in particular, tend to be varied and gorgeous, everything from being textured like gems to having detailed tigers stretching up the barrel. Many of the most recent operator outfits and headgear options have started branching into cool and creative territory beyond just different shades of camo, like Valkyrie\u2019s Pop Art make-up or Blackbeard\u2019s dapper top hat. The problem, however, is that the store itself has become a big pile of stuff that\u2019s nearly impossible to navigate. It\u2019s hard to browse and hard to search, especially when it comes to bundles. Items will helpfully tell you if they are available in a bundle, but there\u2019s no way to then go to that bundle directly, and the bundles tab is an ungodly long text list with a single image to explain everything that\u2019s in it.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"Siege wisely keeps the items in its store away from anything that really affects gameplay. There are a variety of gun scopes and barrel attachments that can be unlocked with Renown that do offer mid-match advantages, but they are cheap enough that this power boost never felt walled off or like it was compromising balance. And, once again, what your gun looks like and the scope you are using can mean next to nothing if your opponent can simply outthink you. Siege has continued to double down on that focus on smart play over the years, and it\u2019s made it a game I want to keep playing for a long time to come.
